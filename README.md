# Team44_RTF-TechFest-23-
Our first school hackathon project.

Problem Statement:
HDB manages over 2000 carparks, with more than 660k car parks and 7000 equipment that supports the operations of the carpark. Our car parks are visited by 500k unique motorists and the system processes 2.5m transactions daily. It is not possible for HDB to deploy staff/maintenance teams to be at every car park, due to the sheer number of car parks and equipment. Also, the situation is exacerbated by the manpower crunch brought about by our aging population. Hence, we are looking for a solution that allows HDB to rely on the residents to take ownership of their estateâ€™s well-being, and partner HDB to improve the estate.

Objective: To leverage on technology (mobile app, crowdsourcing, etc) to create a fun and engaging solution that allows residents to check on HDB car parks, monitor the maintenance/rectification progress if any and take ownership for the well-being of their estate

##Inspiration
We found inspiration in various websites and applications such as oneservice.gov.sg which also has a similar reporting issues feature. Parking@HDB, Hdb.gov.sg, and SGSecure are other platforms we were inspired by while working on the features and layout of our webpage.

##What it does
Our crowdsourcing community website gathers collective, on-site feedback directly from residents which reach HDB, allowing them to take immediate action and ensure proper maintenance as well as update residents about ongoing works in the car parks.

##How we built it
We created our webpage using HTML and CSS. Javascript functions were linked nicely within the HTML sheet to provide a smooth, dynamic web experience. We split the workload by taking subpages to work and merging all of them later to ensure flow. We referred to secondary sources like Youtube tutorials and coding websites to gain inspiration to get started with the code for different features in the website. We researched to get to know about the context of the problem statement and drew out designs before we started to code. We then pieced together everything, with aesthetics and practicality in mind, ensuring the website is user-friendly and accessible.

##Challenges we ran into
As we are still beginners in programming, grasping HTML, CSS, and Javascript concepts within a span of 1.5 days was anxiety-inducing. Fortunately, one of our team members kickstarted the learning process and we researched various online tutorials for creating as many web elements as much as possible. It was confusing to follow through with the jargon, but as we experimented with the designs we built, we found ourselves thoroughly enjoying the process. Due to time constraints, while we expressed a strong desire to attempt the variety of web elements and features available out there, we had to simplify and prioritise the key features to ensure that the user interface experience was simple and smooth, as every user experience should.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
Seeing the buttons work and directing into the subpages was a big morale booster as we finally saw the output working. We are proud of ourselves for taking the first step in participating in our first hackathon and stepping out of our comfort zone to immerse in this thrilling and intensive learning experience through this platform. Being able to create a workable website with no prior experience gives us the confidence to work on more projects.
